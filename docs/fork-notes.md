# Fork notes

This project was forked from the [CloudCannon/jekyll-resize](https://github.com/CloudCannon/jekyll-resize) repo ([jekyll-resize](https://rubygems.org/gems/jekyll-resize) on RubyGems). So that I could use this in my Jekyll 4 project and so others can too.


## Improvements in this fork

- Updated [jekyll-resize.gemspec](/jekyll-resize.gemspec) to use Jekyll 4.
- Updated [jekyll-resize.rb](/lib/jekyll-resize.rb) file.
    - Fixes:
        - Jekyll 4 fix - added `require "mini_magick"` to avoid a runtime error, as constant `MiniMagick::Image` was not defined. This was the main reason for creating this fork initially.
    - Features:
        - Forward slash is no longer required for the input path. So both `image.png` and `/image.png` are valid, not just the second one.
        - Added support for sites on a **subpath** - the `site.baseurl` is prepended now. Also, because of joining with `File.join`, the cache directory in the plugin code need doesn't to start with a forward slash anymore to work.
        - Reworded "Thumbnailing" to "Resizing", because this doesn't have to be used to make thumbnails (which are very small).
        - Reduced hash from 64 to 32 characters long (who needs 64 anyway?).
        - Added validation on plugin inputs as non-empty strings, to avoid errors later.
    - Refactor
        - Created functions to break up the logic.
        - Changed variable names and order of lines.
- Created this `README.md` file and the [docs](/docs/) directory.
- Created [demo](/demo/) directory as a site for local testing of the plugin.
- Created [Makefile](/Makefile)
- Created [.editorconfig](/.editorconfig)
